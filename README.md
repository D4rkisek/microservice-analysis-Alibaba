This research aims to conduct a complex systems analysis of Alibaba’s microservices deployment. By leveraging
data from [Alibaba’s microarchitectural traces from 2022](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata/tree/master/cluster-trace-microservices-v2022), particularly the MSCallGraph dataset.
The primary problem addressed in this research is the understanding patterns in the system.
One of the key aspects of this research involves employing [Raphtory](https://github.com/pometry/raphtory) to determine its effectiveness as a
tool in this context. The ultimate goal is to extract meaningful insights regarding the deployment of
microservices.
